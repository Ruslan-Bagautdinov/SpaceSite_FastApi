docker-compose up --build
```


### Install without Docker

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/space-site.git
cd space-site
```
2. Create a Virtual Environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create a '.env' File:
Create a '.env' file in the root directory of the project and fill in the necessary values. You can use sample.env as a template. Here is an example of what the .env file should look like:
```dotenv
SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=10080
ALGORITHM=HS256

POSTGRES_HOST='localhost'

POSTGRES_DB='fastapi_spacesite_pg'
POSTGRES_USER='postgres'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD='your_postgres_password'

UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY='your_unsplash_access_key'
```
Replace your_secret_key, your_postgres data, and your_unsplash_access_key with your actual values.

5. Set Up the Database:
Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and configured according to the parameters in your '.env' file. Then, run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

6. Run the Application:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
